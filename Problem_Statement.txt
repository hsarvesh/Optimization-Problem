Optimization Problem

Problem Statement:
"A logistics company runs a truck which picks up items from various locations. They have hired you to assist in route planning. Refer the sheet ""Data"". 
The field ""place"" refers to a place where the truck needs to pick an item from. There are a total of 100 such places. Each place has an item of weight mentioned in column ""weight"". All the places can be assumed to be on a 2-dimensional XY plot where the fields ""x_coordinate"" and ""y_coordinate"" represent the location of the place. Example: Place 1 is in (14, -2) coordinate. 

The truck has to start from any one place, collect the weight and then move to next place till it has covered all places and picked up all the items. 
The cost of transportation can be estimated by the product of distance travelled & weight of items in the truck. Your objective is to devise a path such that the total cost is minimum. Write a function which return the best path(s) with the least cost of transportation.

Example:
Let say there were only 3 places: A,B,C and the path A-B-C is selected. The truck starts from place A picks up item of weight 10 and goes to place B which is at a distance of 2 units where it picks up another item of weight 20 and then goes to place C which is at a distance of 5 units from B to finally pickup an item of weight 7 then the cost of transportation can be computed as:

Cost(ABC) = 2 * 10 + 5 * (10+20) = 170

However, other paths like A-C-B, B-C-A, B-A-C, etc. also exists. 
Note: To compute distance, you can use Euclidean distance formula for the distance between two points (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)	"
